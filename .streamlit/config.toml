Next steps
- Create a new GitHub repository (e.g., Brandnn/multi-dashboard) and add the files above.
  - Easiest: use GitHub web UI, Create new file → paste contents, repeat.
  - Or locally:
    - git clone https://github.com/Brandnn/multi-dashboard.git
    - copy the files into the repo folder
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "Add multi-app dashboard"
    - git push origin main
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud pointing at app.py.

Would you like me to:
- create the GitHub repo and push these files for you (I can generate the exact git commands or a curl/gh request — I will need permission details), or
- walk you step-by-step through creating the repo and pushing these files from your computer?

Which do you prefer?
